                <strong>Question:</strong> For each page <code>p</code>, what
                errors have been thrown and what is their breakdown by type?
            </p>
            <p>
                We have partially answered this question in the dashboard by
                looking at the number of errors logged per page in a bar chart
                and a grid that provides a listing of error events that have
                been recorded client-side (using the <code>collector.js</code>
                script).
