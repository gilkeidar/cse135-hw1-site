            <p>
                <strong>Question:</strong> For each page <code>p</code>, what
                errors have been thrown and what is their breakdown by type?
            </p>
            <p>
                We have partially answered this question in the dashboard by
                looking at the number of errors logged per page in a bar chart
                and a grid that provides a listing of error events that have
                been recorded client-side (using the <code>collector.js</code>
                script).
            </p>
            <p>
                However, a more detailed analysis (mini-dashboard) can be done
                using the following per page that has at least one error:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        A number showing the number of errors that occurred on
                        that page.
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                This helps give a sense of how error-prone the
                                page is.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A pie chart showing the breakdown of error events by
                        event type.
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                This lets the developer / administrator know
                                what kind of errors have been logged at a
                                glance (e.g., <code>console-error</code> vs.
                                <code>error</code>).
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A bar chart showing the frequency of each particular
                        error event (to see which errors happen the most often)
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>x-axis:</strong> Error event message
                                string.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>y-axis:</strong> Frequency of each error
                                event message string (as it appears in the 
                                data).
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A grid that contains a listing of the error events that
                        occurred on that page.
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                This allows for a deeper dive into the errors
                                that have occurred on that page (this is
                                essentially allowing for raw data consumption
                                and so is added last since it's only relevant
                                if the developer / administrator wants to
                                critically analyze the errors that have occurred
                                on this particular page)
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
